    <h1>MY VISIT TO THE ZOO </h1> 
    <hr> 
    <p>
        I remember the time i went to the zoo for the first time. It was on a Sunday morning and my father had promised us that he would take us out to visit the zoo in a place called "Omu Resort". I was happy as i had never gone to a zoo before and it would be my first time seeing wild animals face to face. So we entered my father's car and drove to the zoo

When we got to the zoo, we met the receptionist who registered us and assigned us to a tour guide who took us around the zoo. I saw ,for the first time, a real life lion and lioness with two cubs. They said the lion was just 7 years old and it was already very big. We also saw crocodiles and alligators with their sharp teeth. We wanted to throw food at them but the guide said we should not as the animals are very dangerous. We also saw horses, donkeys, hyenas and also a big cat called the tiger. We were told that the tiger is the biggest cat in the cat family.

We then moved on to the snakes section where we saw big and long snakes like the green mamba, the python, the rattlesnake and the giant python. It was so big that they put it outside a cage and in a field because it would be too cramped for it. We also saw other reptiles like the chameleon and the monitor lizard. After that, we went to see the birds. We saw a real life flock of peacocks and peahens with their beautiful feathers. We also saw a pelican, a big with a big mouth, a parrot which could talk and other beautiful birds. We also saw a very tall giraffe and plenty of monkeys. We the decided to leave after taking a lot of pictures with the animals and went home with a memory that will be with me till the end of time. I enjoyed my visit to the zoo.
